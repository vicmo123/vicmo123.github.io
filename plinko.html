								<h2>Overview: </h2>
								<div id="overview">
									<p id="projDesc">This project is a remake of the classic game Plinko, developed as my first-ever game using the Unity engine. It serves as an introduction to Unity by exploring scene creation, prefab usage, scripting, and sound implementation. Players control a ball, moving it sideways and dropping it down the board, aiming to land in winning zones and experience the addictive gameplay of the original Plinko.</p>

											<h3>Physics-base movement</h3>
											<p>To enable movement for the ball in the game, I utilized Unity's physics system. By attaching rigid-bodies to the ball prefab, I established a solid foundation for physics-based interactions. To control the ball's movement, I implemented a script that gathered keyboard inputs and applied the appropriate forces to move the ball in the desired direction. When the player releases the ball, gravity comes into play, causing it to naturally fall downwards.</p>

											<h3>Map design</h3>
											<p>By creating prefabs for different components of the map, I successfully designed the game board, incorporating walls, pins, and distinct zones for winning and losing. Once the board was complete, I proceeded to enhance the overall visual aesthetics of the game by creating a skybox. </p>

											<h3>collision detection</h3>
											<p>Also using Unity's physics system, I familiarized myself with the utilization of colliders and trigger zones. Colliders were employed on the pins, balls, and walls to accurately handle collisions between these objects. By configuring the colliders appropriately, I ensured realistic and responsive interactions. In addition, trigger zones were implemented to detect whether the ball entered specific areas designated as winning or losing zones. These trigger zones provided a mechanism for tracking and determining game outcomes based on the ball's location.</p>

											<h3>Game mechanics</h3>
											<p>To enhance the overall gameplay experience, I implemented several game mechanics that added depth and challenge. This included defining winning and losing conditions. Additionally, I implemented a restart feature that allowed players to reset the game when it is done, returning all objects to their initial positions. To further immerse players in the game, I incorporated various sound effects, including collision sounds to provide auditory feedback during interactions, as well as winning and losing sounds to signify game outcomes.</p>

								<h2>closing thougths: </h2>
								<div class="columns">
									<p>In conclusion, this Plinko game remake has been an exciting project for me as a developer. Through this project, I gained valuable experience with the Unity engine, honing my skills in physics-based movement, map design, collision detection, and game mechanics. It allowed me to explore the possibilities of creating immersive gameplay and visual aesthetics, while also incorporating sound effects for a more engaging experience. Overall, this project served as a solid foundation for my future endeavors in game development, and I'm proud to have completed it within a day. The knowledge and skills I acquired during this process will undoubtedly contribute to my growth as a game developer.</p>
