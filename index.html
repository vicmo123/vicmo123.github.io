									</header>
									<a href="plinko.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/plinko.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project is a remake of the classic game Plinko, developed as my first-ever game using the Unity engine. It serves as an introduction to Unity by exploring scene creation, prefab usage, scripting, and sound implementation. Players control a ball, moving it sideways and dropping it down the board, aiming to land in winning zones and experience the addictive gameplay of the original Plinko.</p>

									<p>Automated Pacman is a game that showcases the use of AI to control the movements of the player and the enemies. The game was developed using C# and Unity, and features a finite state machine for game logic, as well as A* pathfinding for the enemies to navigate the maze. The player's movement is automated as well, with the use of an algorithm that aims for pills while avoiding the enemies. When a pill is eaten, it will target the enemies.</p>

										<h2><a href="rocket.html">Rocket Landing</h2>

									<a href="rocket.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/rocket.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Rocket Landing is a straightforward 2D game that challenges players to skillfully land a ship on platforms. The game incorporates physics-based mechanics, allowing the ship to move around and utilize a thruster that shoots fire.
										The primary objective of the game is to successfully land the ship on the platforms. However, the landing must be executed with precision and finesse. If the ship impacts the platform with excessive force or lands at a steep angle, it will result in a fiery explosion.
										Players must carefully control the ship's movement and use the thruster judiciously to achieve a controlled descent onto the platforms.</p>

										<h2><a href="space-invaders.html">SDL Space Invaders</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="space-invaders.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/space-invaders.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project is a modern remake of the classic game Space Invaders, featuring several enhancements. It was developed using SDL2 and C++ programming language, utilizing a Top-Down/Manager architecture.
										The game incorporates a scrolling tile map, allowing for a dynamic and continuously changing game environment. The enemy ships in the game utilize flocking AI, enabling them to exhibit collective behavior while engaging the player. This adds an extra layer of challenge and strategic gameplay.
										Additionally, the game features a wrap-around system for both the enemy ships and the player. This means that when any of these entities reach the edge of the screen, they wrap around to the opposite side, allowing for seamless movement and engagement without any boundary restrictions.

										<h2><a href="asteroid.html">Asteroid</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="asteroid.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/asteroid.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The Asteroid 2D game is a solo project that is inspired by the classic game Asteroids. The game was built using C# and Unity, and does not use any MonoBehaviours. It features a top-down/manager style architecture, and circle collision detection. To add a sense of challenge and progression, the game implements a difficulty scaling system based on a timer. As time passes, the game enters different rounds, increasing the intensity and complexity of the gameplay. The objective is to survive as long as possible, as the game continues as long as the player has lives remaining.
										The player has the freedom to play the game as many times as they desire, allowing for repeated attempts to achieve a higher score or overcome previous challenges. </p>

									<a href="finite-state-machine.html" class="image fit"><img src="images/fsm.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this simple game, the player's objective is to escape from the enemy. The enemy's behavior is governed by a finite state machine, which controls its actions and decision-making process. Additionally, the enemy utilizes the A* algorithm for movement, enabling it to navigate the game environment effectively. The combination of the finite state machine and A* algorithm ensures that the enemy dynamically responds to the player's movements and attempts to capture them.</p>

									<p>This project serves as a demonstration of the flocking algorithm implementation. It was developed as part of an AI in video game class and features boids that exhibit flocking behavior based on three rules: cohesion, alignment, and separation. Each rule is assigned a weight, and the user has the ability to adjust these values within the editor to observe various behavioral outcomes.</p>

									<p>This project focuses on implementing the A* pathfinding algorithm within an AI in video game class. The algorithm operates on a grid system consisting of ground and walls. Users can select two points on the grid, and the algorithm will determine the most efficient path between them. If there is no viable path, no path will be drawn or displayed.</p>
