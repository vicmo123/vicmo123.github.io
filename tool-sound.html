									<p id="projDesc">I developed a set of editor tools specifically designed to streamline the implementation of sounds in the Maple Wars game. The first tool facilitates the creation of prefabs with an audio source component, allowing for easy attachment of audio clips. With the help of an editor window, the tool guides you through the process and swiftly generates all the desired prefabs in a matter of seconds, eliminating the need for manual creation.
										The second tool utilizes reflection to automatically write the names of all the sounds in the game into an enum file. This enables you to conveniently view and access all the available sound options directly within the editor. By leveraging this tool, you gain a comprehensive overview of the possible sounds that can be utilized in the game, simplifying the sound implementation process and enhancing efficiency.</p>

												<h3>Problem</h3>
												<p>During the development of the Maple Wars game, the implementation of sounds presented two challenges. Firstly, creating and attaching audio clips manually to numerous prefabs was a time-consuming and repetitive task. Secondly, keeping track of available sound options for all the developers.</p>
												<h3>Solution</h3>
												<p>To address these challenges, a set of editor tools was developed specifically designed to streamline sound implementation in the Maple Wars game. The tools include the Prefab Audio Source Creator and the Sound Enum Generator. Wich allowed faster implementation of new sounds.</p>
												<h3>how does it work?</h3>
												<p>The Prefab Audio Source Creator is a user-friendly tool that guides developers through the process of creating prefabs with attached audio source components. With its automated workflow, developers can easily create a set of prefabs with an audio source compnent, and an audio source linked to it, saving time and effort.
												</p>
												<p>The Sound Enum Generator, on the other hand, utilizes reflection to automatically generate an enum file containing the names of all sound files in the game. By scanning the project's sound files, developers can conveniently view and access all available sound options directly within the editor with the created enum. The tool ensures that the enum file stays up-to-date, automatically including new sound files added to the project.
												</p>
												<p>By leveraging these tools together, developers gain an efficient and streamlined workflow for sound implementation. The Prefab Audio Source Creator eliminates the manual creation and attachment of audio clips to prefabs, while the Sound Enum Generator simplifies sound management by automatically generating an enum file. This comprehensive solution enhances productivity, organization, and efficiency throughout the sound implementation process in the Maple Wars game.
