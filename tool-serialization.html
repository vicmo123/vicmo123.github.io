											<h3>Problem</h3>
											<p>During the tools course in school, there was a need for a versatile tool to handle data serialization for multiple falling objects. The challenge was to develop a tool that could save the serialized data in various formats, such as JSON, Binary, and XML, while also providing functionality to load the data and apply it to objects on the screen. Additionally, the tool needed to have a user-friendly interface for controlling the saving, and loading of serialized data, all within a UI-driven environment.</p>
                                            <h3>Solution</h3>
											<p>To address this challenge, I developed a generic serilizer class wich allows you to easily serialize the data in the desire format. I also used an interface called ISerializable to ensure the serializable objects all have the necessary methods in order to be handled by the Serializer. To control the data throught the UI that I designed using the Unity's UI system, I used a MVC inspred approach.</p>
                                            <h3>how does it work?</h3>
											<p>To address the challenge of data serialization for multiple falling objects in the tools course, a versatile solution was developed. This involved adopting an MVC (Model-View-Controller) approach for the user interface (UI) design, along with the creation of a generic Serializer class capable of easily serializing data in various formats such as JSON, Binary, and XML. Additionally, an ISerializable interface was implemented to ensure that serialized objects possess the necessary methods required by the Serializer. The Model encapsulates the data and serialization logic, the View presents the UI elements, and the Controller handles the interaction between the Model and View. This combination allows for an efficient and modular implementation of the serialization process, providing full control over saving, loading, and applying serialized data through the UI. By utilizing the Serializer class, adhering to the ISerializable interface, and leveraging the MVC approach for the UI, developers gain a comprehensive toolset for handling object data, simplifying the serialization process, and enhancing efficiency and usability in the tools course.</p>
