									<h5>Summary: </h5>
									<p>Designed and implemented a 2D platformer game in Unity using C# programming language.</p>
									<h5>Problem: </h5>
									<p>The goal of the project was to create an engaging 2D platformer game that could be enjoyed by players of all skill levels. The game needed to be visually appealing, intuitive to control, and challenging enough to keep players engaged.</p>
									<h5>Approach: </h5>
									<p>To solve this problem, we decided to use Unity as our game engine and C# as our programming language. We used the tile map system to create the levels, and implemented physics-based movement and collision detection for the player character. We also implemented various game mechanics, such as power-ups, enemy AI, and a scoring system.</p>
									<h5>Role: </h5>
									<p>As a team member, my role was to design and develop the level progression system, including the tile map creation and scripting for level transitions. I also helped with testing and debugging, and contributed to the development of the game mechanics.</p>
									<h5>Results: </h5>
									<p>The game was successfully completed and met all of the initial goals and requirements. We received positive feedback from playtesters and were able to identify and fix bugs and issues before release. The game was published on several online game platforms and received over 100,000 plays in the first month after release.</p>
