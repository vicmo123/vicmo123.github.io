											<h3>game flow</h3>
											<p>In order to effectively manage the various states within the game, I implemented the state pattern, allowing for encapsulation and control of the game flow through the game manager. This pattern enabled seamless transitions between different game states, providing a smooth and immersive experience for players. Additionally, I designed a countdown timer that played a crucial role in initiating gameplay. When the timer reached zero, players were prompted to take their shots, adding an element of excitement and anticipation. At the end of each round, the game gracefully reset to its initial state, ready for another round.</p>

											<h3>game mechanics</h3>
											<p>In this local multiplayer, inputs are caputred for each player to play. The player that shoots the fastest wins the game. Using the phases from the state machine, I utilized a sphere to indicate the current round's phase to the players. By manipulating the mesh of the sphere through code, the color changes to represent the various phases of the game. Additionally, distinct sound effects have been implemented to signal important events, such as prompting players when it's time to shoot, indicating when a round resets, and providing auditory feedback when a player shoots a bullet. In the event of a player's death, the game allows them to restart a new round simply by pressing any key. These features enhance the gameplay experience by providing visual and auditory cues, facilitating player understanding and engagement throughout each phase of the game.</p>

											<h3>Level design</h3>
											<p>To enhance the visual appeal of the game, I created various prefabs that I used to populate the level. I created many objects such as cacti, cowboys, a skybox, and a sand platform. This use of prefabs resulted in a more immersive and polished game environment, transporting players to a desertic landscape. The inclusion of these objects adds depth, detail, and thematic consistency to the game, elevating the overall visual experience.</p>
