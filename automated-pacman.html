								<h2>Overview: </h2>
								<div id="overview">
									<p id="projDesc">Automated Pacman is a game that showcases the use of AI to control the movements of the player and the enemies. The game was developed using C# and Unity, and features a finite state machine for game logic, as well as A* pathfinding for the enemies to navigate the maze. The player's movement is automated as well, with the use of an algorithm that aims for pills while avoiding the enemies. When a pill is eaten, it will target the enemies.</p>

									<h2>Contribution: </h2>
									<p>This was a solo project. These are things I worked on during this project:</p>

											<h3>State machine</h3>
											<p>In our AI in video game class, we were given the freedom to select a project to showcase our comprehension of the state machine concept. I decided to embark on this exciting endeavor by creating an automated Pacman game, where the player competes against enemies in an autonomous manner. To accomplish the desired behaviors for both the player and the enemies, I implemented two types of finite state machines. </p>

										<div id="columnItem">
											<h3>A* pathfinding</h3>
											<p>To facilitate the movement of all characters across the map, I integrated the A* pathfinding algorithm using a node system. This algorithm efficiently calculates the optimal route for each character to reach their respective targets while considering the presence of walls as obstacles. By implementing the A* algorithm, the characters are able to navigate the game environment with ease, avoiding obstacles and selecting the best possible paths. This addition enhances the overall gameplay experience by ensuring smooth and intelligent movement for all characters.</p>

											</video>
										</div>
										<div id="columnItem">
											<h3>Behaviour optimization</h3>
											<p>In order to enhance the natural and intelligent gameplay of the characters, I implemented behavior optimizations. This involved incorporating distinct targets and a line of sight mechanic using raycasts. By utilizing these techniques, the enemies were able to prioritize high-priority objects, such as pills and pellets, while also reacting strategically based on their current state. For instance, the player character would target pills and pellets while evading enemies when in the wandering state. However, after consuming a power pellet, the player character would switch to a chasing behavior, actively pursuing and attacking the enemies. This implementation adds depth and complexity to the gameplay, creating a more realistic gamplay style.</p>

With automated player movement, strategic decision-making, Automated Pacman was for me a nice challenge that I am pround of having completed.</p>
