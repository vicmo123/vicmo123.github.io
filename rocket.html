							<h2>Overview: </h2>
							<div id="overview">
								<p id="projDesc">Rocket Landing is a straightforward 2D game that challenges players to skillfully land a ship on platforms. The game incorporates physics-based mechanics, allowing the ship to move around and utilize a thruster that shoots fire.
									The primary objective of the game is to successfully land the ship on the platforms. However, the landing must be executed with precision and finesse. If the ship impacts the platform with excessive force or lands at a steep angle, it will result in a fiery explosion.
									Players must carefully control the ship's movement and use the thruster judiciously to achieve a controlled descent onto the platforms.</p>

									<h3>Cinemachine camera</h3>
									<p>During the development of this 2D rocket flying game, a key implementation was the camera system for smoothly following the ship. To achieve the desired effect, I utilized a Cinemachine camera. This powerful tool allowed for seamless camera movement and tracking, enhancing the player's immersion and overall gameplay experience. By integrating the Cinemachine camera, the game achieved a more polished visual presentation, ensuring that the ship remained in focus and the player had a smooth flight experience throughout the map.</p>

									<h3>Physics based movement</h3>
									<p>In order to enhance realism and enjoyment, I implemented Unity's physics system in the 2D rocket flying game. By utilizing rigid bodies and applying forces, I simulated realistic flight mechanics that replicated the movements a ship would make in space. Additionally, I incorporated physics calculations to determine the force of impact and landing angle, which added a skill-based element to successful landings. This integration of Unity's physics system created a more immersive and satisfying gameplay experience.</p>

									<h3>Wrap-around</h3>
									<p>To ensure smooth and uninterrupted movement for the ship, I introduced a wrap-around feature in the game. By implementing this feature, players can seamlessly transition from one side of the map to the other when they reach the boundaries. This eliminates the need for walls or obstacles that would otherwise impede their progress, allowing for continuous navigation across the game world, and promoting a more immersive and fluid gameplay experience.</p>

									<h3>Thruster</h3>
									<p>To enhance the dynamic feel of the spaceship, I incorporated a thruster feature into its design. By utilizing a sprite-based approach, I achieved a visually appealing thruster effect that adapts to the ship's acceleration. Through careful implementation, the thruster smoothly lerps or transitions its length based on the desired intensity of the ship's movement. This gives the thruster a more natural and organic feel, adding a sense of life and realism to the spaceship. The adaptive thruster not only improves the visual aesthetics but also contributes to the overall immersion and engagement of the players as they witness the ship's propulsion system responding dynamically to its actions.</p>
